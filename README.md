## Assignment checklist
 - [x] App has a button which, when clicked, will display a list of the 20 most recent blocks.
 - [x] When the user clicks on a block they should be taken to a block Details screen.
 - [x] The Details screen should show a summary view of the block which contains the producer, count of
transactions and the producer signature.
 - [x] The Details screen should have a toggle to show and hide the raw contents of the block.
 - [x] Application code is viewable publicly on GitHub.
 - [x] Screenshots of working application should be in the README.
 - [x] Application should be written in Kotlin.
 - [ ] Application should have unit tests.
 
 ## Bonus Tasks

display the keys on that userâ€™s account in the detail screen. The keys should be in PEM format.
 - [x] Application uses MVVM architecture
